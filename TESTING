Platforms to test: Windows 7, Linux (Ubuntu + Fedora), OS/X.

Clear the state by uninstalling, removing the data directory and
making sure that installation directory was successfully removed.

  * It starts and can be connected to
  * It runs as the sandbox user
  * The users and groups start with the default
  * The default ontology starts with the default
  * A reinstall doesn't overwrite the ontologies
  * A reinstall doesn't overwrite the users and groups
  * Linux and OS/X: It continues running on a reboot.
  * Linux and OS/X: The start and stop scripts work

Virtualbox Notes:
  * Sharing files.  Mounting works on windows but I had some trouble
    with Fedora.  Putting the installer and Protege on a usb stick and
    enabling it for the guest works in all cases.

  * Host adapter is a good mode for testing...

  * Fedora firewall can be configured with system-config-firewall.
